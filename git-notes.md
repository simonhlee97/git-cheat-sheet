when creating a new branch, it is important which branch you copy from, as all commits of that branch will be copied over.

Merging branches: if you are on MASTER, and you want to merge "Branch-3" into MASTER, then simply "git merge Branch-3"

#### What is the "Head"?

by default, Head points to latest commit.
